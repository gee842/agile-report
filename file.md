##AGILE Coursewok - 5 weeks in review

This file was written in VIM on a Raspberry Pi- No images will be included in this document.

### 0 The project
	Create a python-flask powered web-app to query various data-sets
	on papers published by members of staff of the University, or from an external University

	Placed in a group of 3, we had 5 weeks to learn to work together as a cohesive team.
	Throughout which we each naturally fell- into our natural roles.


	As this document is completely anonymised, for the sake of readability and berivety
	the names of the people in our group will be defined with the following aliases:

	Me:		 $A
	Teammate1:	 $B
	Teammate2:	 $C


###1. Brief Timeline Summary

### Week 0.
	We were unproductive, which was epxected. We had just met each-other for the first thime, and were
	overcoming communication issues, as well as just generally feeling-out the individual strengths of the members.

	Towards the end of the week, we had assigned roles in preperation for the evaluation of Sprint1.
	
	Initially, I took up the role of SCRUM-master, as I am currently working in a team that uses Agile.

	Tasks for this week:
	$A: Write the array sorting functions that were to be passed back to the Views.py
	$B: Learn Flask and Design a way to encode the sorting into the URL
	$C: Learn Flask and PyCharm (Automated testing, build-scripts, etc)

	Everybody also contributed to finishing Sprint0 (Fix the statistics functions)


### Week 1.
	We met up during that week on Tuesday.
	
	All 3 of us were in Kilburn- $A and $B pair programming the sorting function,
	and $C was still learning how flask worked so they were mostly an observer

	I was beginning to learn how to motivate the team, particularly $C, using positive reinforcement.
	
	An important lesson I learned that week was to be aware of what my team-members were currently doing/debugging,
	and proactively step in to help if I see them struggling.


	The Sprint1 Assesment went well, and we managed to get full marks on that weeks tasks.
	
	As a team, we realized why the marks were high, was because we followed agile principles, despite the stories
	only being mostly complete. As long as we were to justify decisions we made in the context of the Project-Cycle-
	Eg. Choosing to drop a story from the backlog to improve the quality of other stories.

	From that point on, we would be more conscious of the tasks we took on.

### Week 2.

	At this point in time, the team felt quite motivated and had momentum, so we decided to take on all the stories 
	available for that week.
	
	$C was settling in well and was beginning to make contributions at this point, so I was happy with that progress

	I began to put a healthy amount of motivational pressure on $B and $C, 
	pushing them to not settle for anything but full marks.

	From my observation, this worked- as we got 4.5/5 this week. The team was happy and felt accomplished to have
	done a good job this week, which I'm sure has given them more momentum for next week's Sprint :)

	From this week I learned that building up pressure and releasing it is a great way to not only get tasks done,
	but to also make the team grow closer together (Team Building through adversity)


	On a side note, sometime this week I transfered the role of SCRUM-master to $B. 

	The reasoning is because I started taking up the role of merging branches and
	Acceptance Testing the master branch before assesment. I would give myself the title "master-branch-Master" :D
	This was because I had the most experience in working in a production environment out of {$A,$B,$C}
		

	This demonstrates the flexibility of an Agile team, where roles can get reassigned based on personal strengths

	With the week ending on a high note, we decided to take on all Stories again

### Week 3.
	
	Tragedy strikes! We were unable to complete all the stories
	
	I was rewriting all of $C's code for that week, as it didn't produce the right output, and was implemented
	in a way that it would not be reusable/compattible with the rest of the system. To compound that, $C pushed
	the changes to master while I was asleep!

	A broken master branch is not how I like to start my Thursday morning. I proceeded to spend about 7 hours
	from that point rewriting master in time for the marking session the next day.

	What I learned from this: Check up on Teammates regularly! Everyone in the team were partially responsible for 
	this tradgedy, as we were not aware of what $C was doing that week.



Week 0- We did nothing and were setting up Git. we fell one week behind as a result
Week 1- We caught up with all the work and got full marks
Week 2- 4.5/5
Week 3- 9.5/10

What we Learned
	Playing to individual strengths
	Picking up the slack of teammates to meet the project requirments/deadling
	Small Team means that communication went up
	AGILE Boards are amazing
	Useful roles: branch-master and scrum-master
		



Difficulties
	-learning flask
	-skill gap
	-Language barrier/culture barrier
	-burning-out (chart hidden for anonyminity)
