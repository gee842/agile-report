###1. Brief Timeline Summary

### Week 0.
	We were unproductive, which was epxected. We had just met each-other for the first thime, and were
	overcoming communication issues, as well as just generally feeling-out the individual strengths of the members.

	Towards the end of the week, we had assigned roles in preperation for the evaluation of Sprint1.
	
	Initially, I took up the role of SCRUM-master, as I am currently working in a team that uses Agile.
