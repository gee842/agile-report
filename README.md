### The project

	Create a python-flask powered web-app to query various data-sets
	on papers published by members of staff of the University, or from an external University

	Placed in a group of 3, we had 5 weeks to learn to work together as a cohesive team.
	Throughout which we each naturally fell- into our natural roles.


	As this document is completely anonymous, for the sake of readability and brevity
	the names of the people in our group will be defined with the following aliases:

	Me:		 $A
	Teammate1:	 $B
	Teammate2:	 $C


### Brief Timeline Summary (How we approached the project)


### Week 0.
	We were unproductive, which was expected. We had just met each-other for the first time, and were
	overcoming communication issues, as well as just generally feeling-out the individual strengths of the members.

	Towards the end of the week, we had assigned roles in preparation for the evaluation of Sprint1.
	
	Initially, I took up the role of SCRUM-master, as I am currently working in a team that uses Agile.

	Tasks for this week:
	$A: Write the array sorting functions that were to be passed back to the Views.py
	$B: Learn Flask and Design a way to encode the sorting into the URL
	$C: Learn Flask and PyCharm (Automated testing, build-scripts, etc)

	Everybody also contributed to finishing Sprint0 (Fix the statistics functions)


### Week 1.
	We met up during that week on Tuesday.
	
	All 3 of us were in Kilburn- $A and $B pair programming the sorting function,
	and $C was still learning how flask worked so they were mostly an observer

	I was beginning to learn how to motivate the team, particularly $C, using positive reinforcement.
	
	An important lesson I learned that week was to be aware of what my team-members were currently doing/debugging,
	and proactively step in to help if I see them struggling.


	The Sprint1 Assessment went well, and we managed to get full marks on that weeks tasks.
	
	As a team, we realized why the marks were high, was because we followed agile principles, despite the stories
	only being mostly complete. As long as we were to justify decisions we made in the context of the Project-Cycle-
	Eg. Choosing to drop a story from the backlog to improve the quality of other stories.

	From that point on, we would be more conscious of the tasks we took on.


### Week 2.
	At this point in time, the team felt quite motivated and had momentum, so we decided to take on all the stories 
	available for that week.
	
	$C was settling in well and was beginning to make contributions at this point, so I was happy with that progress
	We met up in the middle of the week to get our weekly dose of pair-programming.


	I began to put a healthy amount of motivational pressure on $B and $C, 
	pushing them to not settle for anything but full marks.

	From my observation, this worked- as we got 4.5/5 this week. The team was happy and felt accomplished to have
	done a good job this week, which I'm sure has given them more momentum for next week's Sprint :)

	From this week I learned that building up pressure and releasing it is a great way to not only get tasks done,
	but to also make the team grow closer together (Team Building through adversity)


	On a side note, sometime this week I transferred the role of SCRUM-master to $B. 

	The reasoning is because I started taking up the role of merging branches and
	Acceptance Testing the master branch before assessment. I would give myself the title "master-branch-Master" :D
	This was because I had the most experience in working in a production environment out of {$A,$B,$C}
		

	This demonstrates the flexibility of an Agile team, where roles can get reassigned based on personal strengths

	With the week ending on a high note, we decided to take on all Stories again


### Week 3.	
	Tragedy strikes! We were unable to complete all the stories
	
	I was rewriting all of $C's code for that week, as it didn't produce the right output, and was implemented
	in a way that it would not be reusable/compatible with the rest of the system. To compound that, $C pushed
	the changes to master while I was asleep!

	A broken master branch is not how I like to start my Thursday morning. I proceeded to spend about 7 hours
	from that point rewriting master in time for the marking session the next day.

	What I learned from this: Check up on Teammates regularly! Everyone in the team were partially responsible for 
	this tragedy, as we were not aware of what $C was doing that week.

	The worst part about this was that $C was not working on a remote branch, so what happened was $C pushed
	their local branch straight into master.
	
	Due to this reason, I was unable to complete my story for that week. I explained this to the TA, and it
 	turned out well, because I dropped the story as an AGILE decision.

	What also happened was ScrumMaster $B mistakenly mis-typed a story into the Trello board.
	This led to a misunderstanding that meant now yet another story is incomplete! (Found out on marking day)

	
	Lessons learned:
	
		MAKE REMOTE BRANCHES- Not only for visibility, but safety as well.
		INCREASE COMMUNICATION- Be Aware of what your teammates are doing
		FOLLOW AGILE- Leads to the fastest Minimum-Viable-Project


	The Marking still went well though, from what we learned in Week 1, we had valid and justifiable reasons
	for why we chose to drop certain stories. We got given 9.5/10, further illustrating the different mindset that
	is Agile development
	
	This is a lesson of compromise: not only with the Stories, but also personal compromise being a very important
	aspect of managing a cohesive team. I wasn't thrilled to have to do more work, but it showed me what it means to	compromise on my own time for the team. (Obviously should be invoked in moderation)


### What Went Well?
	Through using AGILE principles, we have grown more cohesive over the 5 weeks as a team,
	Taught me personally that AGILE is amazing for promoting teamwork

	I now have a new-found respect for Jira/Trello/AGILE-boards, and realized their power in streamlining
	the work of the team, giving massive boosts to productivity              

	We were able to get over language, cultural, and communication differences, and pulled through in the end.
	Despite difficulties along the way, there was never any tension in the group, and we were still friendly.

	I personally learned a life lesson of having to compromise/pick up the slack of others, in order to
	achieve my longer-term goals.

	I'm sure through the project's duration, all of us have a better idea of what our individual strengths are-
	For example I learned that I would be a great Tech Lead/Scrum-master, and this project has given me the
	confidence and assurance, and has me thinking of future career paths.


### What did not go well?
	Since this is anonymous, in all honesty I felt that $C was much more of a burden than an asset to the team.
	However due to the relationship we built as a team, I chose not to go forwards to Caroline or Rob with this.
	
	The reason for this is because I saw $C put in genuine effort in learning despite their limited experience,
	and I respect that.

	The stories were vague at times (Which is a huge part of AGILE- deriving customer requirements), which led
	to features not exactly how the "customer" requested. However, this is a big part of the experiences
	that will be had working in an AGILE team.

	We were all unfamiliar with Flask. Thankfully, my Job is in Python, so I was able to guide them in the right
	direction. Demonstrates how individual strengths can be used to empower the whole team.

	Because we took on so many tasks, we burned-out pretty fast.

	This can be seen in our burn up chart (not displayed here for annonyminity)- where the aggregated story points
	line was diverging from the trajectory line (total points we chose to take up)


###	Q: How did we Tackle Problems?
	A: In an Agile Way: Which focuses on communication and transparency!

	Even though there were some hiccups, we found that working as a team was the best way to solve problems
	(I have highlighted many teamwork/team-building examples in the sections above)
	
	The "how" of how we tackled problems were thoroughly covered in the Timeline section
	


### Conclusion
	I liked this course a lot, probably one of the most useful I have taken in my 4 years at UoM.
	Do not regret taking this as a sub module, it has made me a more employable developer.


	Suggestions for next year:
		Make the weekly Stories more clear (to reduce communication issues)
		Make the weekly Stories less clear (to simulate clients in real life)
		Have more TAs marking us, most groups spent 2 hours waiting around every week




	Hope you enjoyed the read,

	$A
